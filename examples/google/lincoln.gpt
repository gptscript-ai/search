tools: google-image from ../../tool.gpt, sys.exec?

Find an image of the Lincoln Memorial. Select an image at random from the search results and download it to the local filesystem using the `wget` command.
If an image download fails, try the next image from the results.

Rename the downloaded file so that it has the proper extension (for example, .jpg).

You have access to the ffmpeg command. Use it to resize the image to 512 pixels vertically and maintain the aspect ratio.
