tools: bing-image from ../../tool.gpt, sys.exec?

Find an image of a mountain landscape. Download it to the local filesystem using the `wget` command.
If an image download fails, try the next image from the results.

Rename the downloaded file so that it has the proper extension (for example, .jpg).

You have access to the ffmpeg command. Distort the image using it.
